# Problem 1

# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### Governing Equations of Motion

The motion of a projectile can be described using the basic principles of kinematics. Let's break down the motion into its horizontal and vertical components.

Let:
- \( v_0 \) = initial velocity
- \( \theta \) = angle of projection
- \( g \) = acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \))

The initial velocity can be resolved into its components:
- Horizontal component: \( v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(\theta) \)
- Vertical component: \( v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta) \)

The equations of motion are given by:

1. **Horizontal Motion**:
   \[
   x(t) = v_{0x} t = v_0 \cos(\theta) t
   \]

2. **Vertical Motion**:
   \[
   y(t) = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
   \]

To find the time of flight, we set \( y(t) = 0 \) when the projectile returns to the ground:

\[
0 = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

Factoring out time \( t \), we have:

\[
t(v_0 \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2} g t) = 0
\]

This gives two solutions: \( t = 0 \) (launch time) or 

\[
t = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \quad \text{(time of flight)}
\]

### Range as a Function of Angle

The horizontal range \( R \) is the horizontal distance covered by the projectile when it returns to the launch height (i.e., \( y = 0 \)). Substituting \( t \) into the horizontal motion equation gives us:

\[
R = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \cos(\theta)) \left(\frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}\right)
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

### Family of Solutions

The range \( R \) is a function of the angle \( \theta \) and is influenced by initial velocity \( v_0 \) and gravitational acceleration \( g \). Variations in these parameters lead to different projectile paths (trajectories) but still adhere to the same underlying equations.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

### Dependency of Range on Angle of Projection

The derived equation \( R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \) shows that the range reaches its maximum when \( \theta = 45^\circ \) because \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \).

### Influence of Other Parameters

- **Initial Velocity** \( v_0 \): Increasing \( v_0 \) increases the range quadratically.
- **Gravitational Acceleration** \( g \): An increase in \( g \) decreases the range. Therefore, on planets with lower gravity, the range would be larger for the same initial velocity and angle.

## 3. Practical Applications

The idealization of projectile motion can be extended to more complicated scenarios such as:

- **Uneven Terrain**: Modifying the equations for different launch and landing heights.
- **Air Resistance**: Incorporating drag forces which depend on the shape and velocity of the projectile can be modeled using differential equations.

## 4. Implementation

### Python Simulation and Visualization

Below is a Python script that simulates projectile motion and visualizes the range as a function of the angle of projection.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
g = 9.81  # m/s^2

def projectile_range(v0, theta):
    return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta)) / g

# Initial conditions
v0 = 50.0  # initial velocity in m/s
angles = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 180)  # angles from 0 to 90 degrees in radians

# Calculate range
ranges = projectile_range(v0, angles)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(np.degrees(angles), ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s', color='blue')
plt.title('Range of a Projectile as a Function of the Angle of Projection')
plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (m)')
plt.axvline(x=45, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Optimal Angle (45Â°)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.xlim(0, 90)
plt.ylim(0, max(ranges) * 1.1)
plt.show()
```

### Graphical Representation

The graph generated by the code above shows the relationship between the range and angle of projection, highlighting the optimal angle at \( 45^\circ \).

### Limitations and Suggestions for Improvement

This model assumes:
- No air resistance
- Flat terrain

**Incorporating More Realistic Factors**:
- Introduce drag force in the model to account for air resistance.
- Adjust the equations for projectiles launched from different heights.
- Explore the impact of wind and other environmental factors.

## Conclusion

The analysis of projectile motion reveals that fundamental physics principles govern the range as a function of the angle of projection. By employing numerical methods and simulations, we can explore a broader range of conditions, making this topic applicable to various fields such as sports, engineering, and astrophysics.
